    "This project employs exploratory data analysis to extract valuable information for Microsoft Corporation, aiming to establish a new movie studio. By analyzing datasets from IMDB and Box Office Mojo, the project provides recommendations regarding the film genres that Microsoft should consider exploring. \n",

    "The success and popularity of each genre are evaluated using two key metrics: the total gross incomes and the average ratings. The results suggest that Microsoft would benefit from concentrating on genres such as Sci-Fi, adventure, animation, and action, as these genres have demonstrated higher total gross income."
